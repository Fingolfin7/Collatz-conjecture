# Collatz-conjecture

Python script to visualize collatz conjecture in matplotlib

## What *is* the Collatz Conjecture?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture):

   > The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns sequences defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the      > previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous    > term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

## The Program

The program asks the user to enter a list of seeds and plots the values in matplotlib.
The console outputs the sequences for each seed as well as the largest value found in the sequence.
